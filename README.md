Welcome to our E-commerce website built with the React.js framework. This project leverages the capabilities of React and utilizes the fakestoreapi to fetch product data. The front-end is designed with React.js and Bootstrap, offering a seamless user experience. Additionally, the project showcases effective communication between parent and child components.

## Getting Started

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Execute `npm start` to launch the app in development mode.
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to explore the application.
6. The page will automatically reload as you make changes, and any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can use the following scripts:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. Refer to the [running tests documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more details.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder, bundling React in production mode and optimizing performance. The filenames include hashes for versioning, and your app is ready for deployment. Refer to the [deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you feel the need to customize build tools and configurations, you can use this command to gain full control over dependencies. Keep in mind that this operation is irreversible. While it provides flexibility, it's not mandatory for small to mid-sized deployments. The curated feature set is designed to meet most deployment needs without requiring ejection. Feel free to customize when you are ready.
